# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

##  Project Overview

The goal is to classify digits (0-9) from images, as found in the popular **MNIST** dataset. This is a classic problem in image classification and computer vision.

##  Features

- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for model creation
- Trains on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images)
- Achieves over 98% accuracy on test data
- Predicts custom images uploaded by the user (optional)
- User-friendly code structure for beginners

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (optional for evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook (for visualization and training)
